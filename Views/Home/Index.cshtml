        <h1>Welcome to My Hobby - Snowboarding</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>I love snowboarding because of the freedom and adrenaline it brings. Carving down the mountain, feeling the crisp air, and hitting jumps makes every run exciting. I enjoy the challenge of improving my control, whether it's mastering tight turns, going off jumps, or riding through fresh powder. Night skiing at Sundance adds a whole new vibe, with the quiet slopes and cool air making it even more thrilling. Plus, practicing tricks at Woodward Park City keeps things fun and pushes me to get better.</p>
        <p>If I were to tutor a new snowboarder, I’d focus on building confidence and control from the start. I’d teach them the basics of stance, balance, and edge control, helping them get comfortable with their board. We’d start with simple exercises like skating, falling safely, and making controlled turns on gentle slopes. Once they have the fundamentals down, I’d introduce techniques for carving, stopping effectively, and adjusting for different snow conditions. If they’re up for it, I’d also help them try small jumps or terrain park basics at a place like Woodward Park City. My goal would be to make learning fun while helping them progress at their own pace.</p>
